    <h1>Giant Clam</h1>

    <h2>Anatomy</h2>
    <p>Young T. gigas are difficult to distinguish from other species of Tridacninae. Adult T. gigas are the only giant
        clams unable to close their shells completely. Even when closed, part of the mantle is visible, unlike the very
        similar T. derasa. However, this can only be recognized with increasing age and growth. Small gaps always remain
        between shells through which retracted brownish-yellow mantle can be seen.</p>

    <h3>Largest Specimens</h3>
    <p>The largest known T. gigas specimen measured 137 centimetres (4 ft 6 in). It was discovered around 1817 on the
        north
        western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and its shells are now on display in a museum in Northern Ireland. The
        joint
        weight of the two shells is 230 kilograms (510 lb), which suggests that the live weight of the animal would have
        been roughly 250 kilograms (550 lb).[12][13]</p>
